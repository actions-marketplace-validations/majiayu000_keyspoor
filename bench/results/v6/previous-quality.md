# Secret scanner benchmark

Generated: 2026-10-03T13:59:34Z

Offline, default-rule end-to-end comparison. First-run is a new process, not a cold disk-cache claim. Warm runs start new processes after an unmeasured warmup. No provider validation is enabled. Raw scanner output is discarded.

| Tool | Dataset | Status | Median ms | Input MiB/s | Peak RSS MiB | TP/FP/FN | Unlocalized | Localized P / recall lower bound / F1 |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|---|

Schema/scoring v2: precision excludes unlocalized results and is conditional on localized unique findings, not a real-world false-positive estimate. Recall is a confirmed-location lower bound; unlocalized findings do not prove a miss or a hit. Duplicate detections do not increase recall. Exact byte-span, overlapping-span and line-only matches are counted separately in JSON; line-only tools have weaker localization evidence. Tools have different default rules and coverage, so throughput alone does not rank engine efficiency. Unavailable and unsupported entries are not zero scores.

Hardware: `{"cpu": "Apple M2 Max", "logical_cpus": 12, "machine": "arm64", "memory_bytes": "103079215104", "python": "3.14.7", "system": "macOS-26.5.2-arm64-arm-64bit-Mach-O"}`

See the JSON artifact for versions, commands, exits, per-run timings, CPU, RSS, corpus hashes, labels and completeness. RSS is per-child getrusage peak; it is not a simultaneous aggregate for a multiprocess tree.
